Post Mortem: Web Server Stack Debugging Task

Summary:
The goal of this web server stack debugging task was to assess the performance of a web server setup featuring Nginx under pressure and address the issue of a high number of failed requests. The task involved using the ApacheBench benchmarking tool to simulate HTTP requests and identify the cause of the failures. The issue was successfully resolved by adjusting the Nginx configuration.

Timeline:
- Initial benchmarking test:
  - 2000 requests were made to the server with 100 requests executed concurrently.
  - Out of the 2000 requests, 943 requests failed, resulting in a significant number of non-2xx responses.
- Debugging and Resolution Steps:
  - Identified the need to investigate the Nginx configuration.
  - Examined the benchmarking results and observed that the failures were "Length" failures.
  - Developed a Puppet manifest (`0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`) to modify the Nginx configuration.
  - Applied the Puppet manifest to fix the issue.
- Final benchmarking test:
  - Executed the benchmarking test again with the updated Nginx configuration.
  - All 2000 requests were successful, and there were no reported failures.
  - Improved performance metrics were observed, including higher requests per second and faster response times.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the high number of failed requests was an issue with the Nginx configuration. The initial configuration was not optimized to handle the specified load and resulted in failures when handling concurrent requests. This led to "Length" failures, indicating that the server did not return the expected response length for a significant number of requests.

Resolution:
To address the issue, the following changes were made to the Nginx configuration:

- Increased the number of worker processes to handle concurrent connections.
- Adjusted event settings to optimize worker connections.
- Enabled sendfile, tcp_nopush, and tcp_nodelay to improve file transfer performance.
- Set an appropriate keepalive timeout.
- Increased the types_hash_max_size to handle a larger number of file types.
- Configured a default server block listening on port 80, specifying the root directory and index file.
- Added a location block to handle requests, attempting to serve files or returning a 404 response.

These changes aimed to optimize the Nginx configuration for improved performance and error handling.

Lessons Learned:
1. Thorough benchmarking and monitoring are essential to identify and address performance issues in web server setups.
2. Logs play a vital role in debugging and diagnosing issues. They provide valuable insights into the root cause of failures.
3. Regularly reviewing and fine-tuning the server configuration can help optimize performance and prevent issues under high load.
4. Using configuration management tools like Puppet allows for systematic and reproducible changes to the server configuration.
5. Collaboration between development and operations teams is crucial in troubleshooting and resolving issues in web server stacks.

Recommendations:
1. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify and address performance issues in real-time.
2. Continuously review and optimize the server configuration based on workload patterns and expected traffic.
3. Regularly perform load testing and stress testing to validate the server's performance and identify any bottlenecks or scalability issues.
4. Encourage collaboration between development and operations teams to facilitate effective troubleshooting and issue resolution.
5. Maintain detailed documentation of server configurations and changes made to assist in future debugging and performance tuning efforts.

By conducting a thorough post mortem analysis and implementing the recommended measures, the team can improve the resilience, performance, and stability of the web server stack in preparation for future challenges and higher loads.
